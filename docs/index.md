(Please note that this a project for a course in University and I do not support the system, it is merely academic to compare what China's Social Credit System could look like in a Western Libertarian country like the USA)

# A system whose goal is to encourage freedom of the individual to a dystopic level

## Values
### Liberty
### Freedom
### Libertarian Capitalism

## How does it work?
Do a good deed, be rewarded with points. Do something bad, lose points. Simple enough! Everyone starts neutral at `500 points` with a maximum of `1000 points` and minimum of `0 points`.

### Good Deeds
* Being a business owner and creating jobs
* Encouraging competitive markets
* Being a patriot to your country

### Bad Deeds
* Participating in cooperatives
* Creating worker unions
* Voting for socialist candidates
* Voting for policies that could limit freedom such as:
  * Limit gun rights

## Differences with China's Social Credit System.
Atlas's Law is meant to be competitive rather than cooperative which is what China's SCS is meant to be.

## The Great Purge AKA `GAME OVER`
Twice a year, the scores of the people are checked against the minimum of `100 points` threshold. If an individual has a score lower than the threshold for the last `3 years`, they are executed as they are considered a person too toxic for society.

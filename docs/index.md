(Please note that this a project for a course in University and I do not support the system, it is merely academic to compare what China's Social Credit System could look like in a libertarian country)

# A system where **you** matter most  
Atlas's law represents the future of our capitalist democracy. The system aims to reward all citizen who value liberty, freedom and the free market. It will enter its beta period in 2020.
*** 
## The prosperity of the individual benefits all
We believe that one's strength and passion can raise everyone's living standard. By creating legislation that inhibited these natural leaders from doing their best, past lawmakers crippled both our economy and our people. As a society, it is in our best interest to allow our best citizen to shine and bring prosperity to our nation.

# What **you** should value

## Freedom
Freedom is the core value of ATLAS. The more freedom an individual has, the more likely he is to succeed. Any rules or measures that limit individual or group liberty are to be dismantled.

## Libertarian Capitalism
Market only fail when you cripple it with legislation and regulations. Letting the market shift naturally is not only beneficial, but the most democractic way to manage the economy.

## How does it work?
Do a good deed, be rewarded with points. Do something bad, lose points. Simple enough! Everyone starts neutral at `500 points` with a maximum of `1000 points` and minimum of `0 points`.

Note that anyone can search for the score of any other individual.

### Gain points by being a productive member of the free world
* Owning a business
* Being employed/creating jobs
* Encouraging a competitive and healthy market
* Buying shares/being active in a financial market
* Sharing the merits of freedom and capitalism on social media

### You may lose point if you take part in any of these activities
* Any crime currently in the criminal code such as
  * Murder
  * Sexual assault
  * Theft
* Participating in any form of market manipulation/control (cooperatives, cartels, undisclosed merges/sells)
* Participation/Creation of unions/syndicates
* Supporting communist/marxist/socialist lawmakers
* Voting for policies that could limit freedom of individuals or groups such as:
  * Restrictions to gun rights
  * Limiting access/support to private institutions (schools, healthcare)
  * Increasing taxes for any socioeconomic group or businesses 

### A number you can trust
Your score is updated after any good and bad deed is added to the system. Be careful: if your score is too low, you will not be able to add information to the system, such as **reports** or **appeals**.

### Point advantages
The more points you have in this system and the more social advantages you get. Here are examples of such examples:
* Be exonerated from minor crimes at the expense on losing points in the system
* Have more freedoms in the current law (access to military grade weapons, ability to purchase restricted land, etc)

## Differences with China's Social Credit System
Atlas's Law core difference from China's SCS is that it encourages the freedom of the individual. To China, a propesrous society is born out of cooperation, while competition is at the core of any good capitalist system. Whithout competition, there would be no innovation.

## When freedoms clash
When discussing laws, we often arrive at a conflict between two freedoms. One of the most common example is this phenomenon is abortion. Who's liberty come first? The mother, or the child? As the mother, you have your freedoms limited for a period of 9 months: you cannot drink or smoke, maintain an unhealthy diet or work. You are stuck with what you might consider to be an intruder or a parasite. But what of the freedom of the fetus? He has the freedom to live just as much as anyone else. Why would we allow the murder of an individual who has yet to even live?

## The Great Purge AKA `GAME OVER`
Twice a year, the scores of the people are checked against the minimum of `100 points` threshold. If an individual has a score lower than the threshold for the last `3 years`, they are executed as they are considered a person too toxic for society.
